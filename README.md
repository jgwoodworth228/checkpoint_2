## Introduction

This checkpoint will give you a chance to self-assess your understanding of generating resources, creating associations and signing users in to an application.

You'll generate a generic learning management system that might be used in a school setting. It should support the following user stories:

- As a user, I should be able to create courses
- As a user, I should be able to see a list of all available courses
- As a user, I should be able to edit or destroy courses that I've created
- As a user, I should be able to enroll in courses
- As a user, I should be able to see a list of courses that I'm enrolled in
- As a user, I should only be able to see or update my own enrollments
- As a user, I should be able to drop courses
- As a user, I should be able to mark courses as completed

Challenge 1:
- As an administrator, I should be able to CRUD enrollments for any user

Challenge 2:
- Use JavaScript to smooth out the UI interactions

**You'll need to decide on the domain model, including table names and columns, that will best support these user stories. Please reach out to us if you need some help with this step.**
